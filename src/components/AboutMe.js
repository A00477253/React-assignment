            <p>About Myself:</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>I am a Backend Java Developer with around 4 years of experience in developing software solutions. 
                I have been actively involved in all phases of the software development life cycle, 
                with a strong focus on web-based applications. As a dedicated team player, 
                I thrive on collaboration and bring a well-organized approach to every project. 
                My analytical skills, coupled with a deep understanding of Java and related technologies, 
                allow me to deliver high-quality, high-impact solutions that maximize organizational efficiency.
                Apart from this I would also love to play cricket , Batmitton , Chess and watch movies </p>
            <p>Why I joined the MCDA program?</p>
            <br />
            <p>I feel the need to expose myself to
                academics and research in Canada which is one of the world leaders in Data Analytics. I have chosen
                St. Maryâ€™s University as the place where I would like to pursue my Master&#39;s degree in Computing and
                Data Analytics, because I find courses in the graduate program such as Web, Mobile, and Cloud
                Application Development and UI/UX Design will help me to transit from Backend Web Developer to
                Full Stack Web Developer. In addition to, the course Business Intelligence and Data Visualization will
                add value to my Data Analyst portfolio</p>
